3//. EVENT LISTENER AND PARTIAL FUNCTION DEFINITION

 //newStory is inmutable so here we are basically writinng newStory now has this replaced, then newStory now has this replaced, and so on
 //before i had stuff like "let replaceX = storyText.replaceAll("insertX, xItem);
newStory = newStory.replaceAll("insertx", xItem);
newStory = newStory.replace("inserty", yItem);
